    break or after triple dashes (`---`) becomes part of the long form
    description of the issue, using Markdown.

    • a username
    • a team name
    • username\@team

    If only a username is given, the issue is assigned to that user in their
    default team.  If only a team name is given, the issue is created
    unassigned in that team.  If both are given, the issue is created in the
    given team and assigned to the given user.

    If `NAME` ends with `(!)` or 🔥 it will be marked urgent.  If it ends with
    `(?)` or ☎️ it will be created in the To Discuss state.  These two markers
